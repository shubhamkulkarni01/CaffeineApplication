Caffeine is an application that allows Android users to keep their screen on 
for a limited amount of time. It is accessed using a quick-settings tile to 
simplify access for users. It allows users to select 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and
unlimited amounts of caffeine for their screen, which is the amount of time the
screen will stay on.

The goal is to incorporate this feature into the AOSP pipeline.
